### Bogo Sort ###
A bogo sort is a purposefully inefficient algorithm for sorting a sequence. Today we will be using this for strings to test for equality.

### Rules ###
Given a scrambled string N and another string M. You must sort N so that it matches M. After it has been sorted, it must output how many iterations it took to complete the sorting.

## Sample Inputs & Outputs ##

Input:
Bogo("lolhe","Hello")

Output:
1456 iterations

## Bonus ##
For a bit of fun, the LEAST efficient algorithm wins. Check out the bogo-bogo sort, an algorithm that's designed not to succeed before the heat death of the universe
